This is a GitHub Pages repository (`avinashkr29.github.io`) that serves as a simple static website. The primary purpose is to host an `app-ads.txt` file for advertising configuration.

## Repository Structure

- `app-ads.txt` - Advertising configuration file containing publisher IDs for Google AdSense, Facebook, and other ad networks
- `README.md` - Basic repository description with website URL

```bash
# View current status
git status

# Add and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Push to deploy to GitHub Pages
git push origin main
```

## Development Notes

- This repository uses GitHub Pages for hosting
- The site is accessible at https://avinashkr29.github.io/
- No build process or package managers are used
- Changes pushed to the main branch are automatically deployed via GitHub Pages
- The app-ads.txt file is served directly from the root and is accessible at https://avinashkr29.github.io/app-ads.txt

## Development rules:
1. always think about the user experience, the ui, /ux, the flow, and make is awesome/wow feel. use context7 and firecrawl mcp servers for latest information . 
2. Ask me for more guidelines if you are confused of need more details.
3. always check that there are no compiling error, and that the app will run once you are done. if error, correct it. 
4. Very important: While coding, desigining, or anything, think like an apple designer. Keep it minimalistic, clean, premium, aesthetics like.
5. Never give any contribution to yourself that you are making this. it is made by me - avinash.
